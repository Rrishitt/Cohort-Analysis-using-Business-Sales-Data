# 📊 Business Growth & Cohort Analysis

Ever wondered **why revenue grows but profits don’t feel the same**?  
This project answers that — with data, not vibes.

I performed a full **end-to-end business & cohort analysis** on a real-world e-commerce dataset to uncover what’s actually driving growth, where money is leaking, and what management should do *next*.

---

## 🚀 What This Analysis Covers

✅ Revenue, Orders & AOV trends  
✅ Category-wise, Payment-wise & Region-wise revenue breakdown  
✅ Customer Cohort & Retention Analysis (the real truth)  
✅ Cancellation & refund leakage detection  
✅ High-value / power-customer identification  
✅ Actionable recommendations for sustainable growth  

No dashboards-for-the-sake-of-it.  
Everything ties back to **business decisions**.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

📉 Retention drops below **8% by Month 2**  
💸 Cancellations exceed completed orders  
📦 Revenue is dangerously dependent on a single category  
💎 High-value repeat customers exist — but are unmanaged  

Translation: **growth is happening, but inefficiently**.

## 🧠 Key Insights (TL;DR for Executives)

- Growth is **event-driven**, not retention-led  
- Most revenue comes from the **first purchase only**  
- Small retention improvements = massive revenue upside  
- Operational inefficiencies are silently killing profit

## 🧠 Final Thought

This project isn’t about showing how many charts I can make.  
It’s about proving I can **turn messy data into decisions that grow businesses**.

If this made you think — mission accomplished. 🚀
